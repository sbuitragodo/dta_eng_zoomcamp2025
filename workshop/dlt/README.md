# dlt workshop: data ingestion

In this module, I understand how to create, run, and maintain data pipelines using dlt.

## Key Learnings
- **Extract**: Extracted raw data from Rest API.
- **Normalize**: Normalized the extracted data (names, format, unnested).
- **Load**: Loaded the data to duckdb.

## Notes
- Documentation is really good!

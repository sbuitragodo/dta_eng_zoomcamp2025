# Module 2: Orchestration with Kestra

In this module, I explored and practiced orchestration concepts using **Kestra**, focusing on the following tasks:

## Key Learnings
- **Setting up Kestra**: Configured the Kestra environment on a local machine and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Managing Secrets**: Used **Kestra Vault** to securely store and access secrets.
- **Working with Variables and Triggers**: Defined variables and set up triggers for dynamic workflows.
- **Scheduled Flows and Backfill**: Scheduled workflows and performed backfill operations to process historical data.

## Notes
- I encountered an issue while executing a workflow locally (using GitHub Codespaces) in the Kestra UI. This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywAPYNYFaB4&ab_channel=Kestra) was instrumental in debugging the problem.
- Setting up and executing Kestra's flows in GCP was straightforward, thanks to the provided videos.

This module was an excellent introduction to leveraging Kestra for orchestration in both local and cloud environments.

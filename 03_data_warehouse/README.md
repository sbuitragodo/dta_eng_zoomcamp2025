# Module 3: Data Warehouse with BigQuery

In this module, I explored and learned about Data Warehouse using BigQuery.

## Key Learnings
- **External and Materialized Tables**: Created external and materialized tables in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) from parquet files in Google Storage (Buckets).
- **Partition and Clustering**: Evaluated what's the best strategy for partitioning and/or clustering tables based on query requirements.
- **Estimating Costs**: Used the estimator to evaluate queries from different tables (Materialized, Partitioned/Clustered).
- **Queries**: Created queries to answer questions related to the NY Taxis dataset.

## Notes
- Quick module to review these concepts.
